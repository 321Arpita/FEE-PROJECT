            <p>Hello everyone! I'm from a small city named Saharanpur. 
                I often found myself looking for new recipes to make in order to quench my hunger 
                and found it quite tiring to look for something new that didn't aquire to my taste. 
                When I talked to my friends about this they felt the same.
            </p>
            <p>So, we decided to create a website to solve this issue in our live and working on this project
                we didn't realise when it became a project of importance to the three of us 
            </p>
            <p>We dicided to make it such that no other hostler ever has to go through the husstle to find
                what to eat at night
